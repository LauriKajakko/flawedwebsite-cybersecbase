Flaws to implement:

Injection
- unsanitized SQL

Broken auth
- easily available session-id token

Cross-site Scripting
- input not sanitized
- user can submit form with script tags

Sensitive data exposure
- Store user credentials in clear text (SQLi to get them and then they are not encrypted)

Security misconfig
- djangos csrf token missing from html file
